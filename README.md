# @vznh/components
This library is a bunch of handmade components that I've found to be replicable across multiple projects, yet unique amongst the crowd.

## Components
**LED**

I use this for animations, running numerous frames as a loading icon.

**Reactive**

I use this for drastically changing numbers that will **always** pull the visual hierarchy, so might as well make it pretty.

## Installation
```bash
npx @vznh/components add component-name
```
